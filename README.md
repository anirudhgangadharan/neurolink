# neurolink
NeuroLink is a browser-based puzzle/action hybrid where you connect neural nodes to stabilize a central hub before energy or time runs out. Built as a single-file deployable (index.html), it combines clean ES6 architecture, deterministic procedural generation, performance-conscious rendering, and WebAudio SFX â€” all without external dependencies.
